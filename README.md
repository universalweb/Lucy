# What is Lucy?

Lucy is a modern, performant, compact, and async focused utility library.
It's built to provide all the little utility functions developers typically need.
All main objects have some utility function available to it.
Lucy is designed to be everything you may need except DOM related operations that you'll find in Acid Lucy's older brother.
Lucy is also the default utility library for the Universal Web & is used for building Universal Web Apps.
UWA(Universal Web Apps) build themselves based on user actions and application state.
